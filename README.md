logo-in-the-browser
===================

This project is based on Marc Feeley's [gambit-in-emacs-in-the-browser](https://github.com/feeley/gambit-in-emacs-in-the-browser) and intends to provide an interactive environment to play with my solution for the [former UCB CS61A Programming project no.4](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Ecs61a/reader/vol1.html).

My original project targeted for non-browser environment, can be found on GitHub as well. See: [CS61A/Logo](https://github.com/imrehorvath/CS61A/tree/master/Logo)
